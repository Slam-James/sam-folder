echo"In the aftermath of the battle, a new era of peace and reconstruction began. The galaxy began to heal as the Jedi Order was reestablished and the Dominion's remnants were scattered to the winds. Kaela, Renn, and their companions became the heroes of a new generation, inspiring countless others to stand up against tyranny and fight for the light.

And so, the legacy of the Galactic Rift continued, as the galaxy learned that even in the darkest of times, hope could rise like a star in the night sky, illuminating the path to a better future."
